# Python-GraphPlottingUsingPandas
 Python is a simple programming language and it's vast world of libraries make it look more usable.
 
 Here in this code, I have used pandas(https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to visualize data read from a source.
 
 1) Here is a source file from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/births/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv which contains the year and no of births across the entire US country.
 2) Find the aggregate for the max data across each year and plotting it in a graph.
 
 The output obtained is save as a image.
